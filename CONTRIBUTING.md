# Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome, however, except for very small changes, kindly file an issue and let's have a discussion before you open a pull request.

Read Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.
